# Paraphrasing-Tool
Plagiarism Removal is made by using nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) using a simple concept  of synonyms set that comes with wordnet. Lemmas can be used and then their names will be synonyms. Randomly, any synonym can be assigned without changing the context. Everytime, program is run, the user can get a different flavour of plagiarism removed text each time, making the user have different options and then the user can simply go with the one which he/she finds most appropriate as per his/her need. But after certain iterations, user may start getting same content.

2. Copy Paste the code of .py file in any python IDE and run it.
3. A GUI will be opened.
4. Type your text to Paraphrase.
5. Press Paraphrase button.
6. Repress Paraphrase button to get another flavour of Paraphrase Text.
